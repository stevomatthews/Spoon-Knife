### SRT Version History & Compatibility

SRT is designed to be backwards compatible, so that new or upgraded
Haivision products will be able to support SRT interactions with older
ones. Note, however, that newer versions of SRT may have features
unavailable on older   ones.

The table below shows the availability of SRT on various versions of
Haivision products:

### Basic SRT Concepts

#### Source & Destination

The SRT protocol relies on bi-directional UDP traffic to optimize video
streaming over public networks. In addition to the video data that is
sent in one direction --- from a content **source** device (such as a
Makito X Encoder) to a **destination** (such as a Makito X Decoder)

--- there is a constant exchange of control information between the two
endpoints, including "keep alive" packets (if needed) approximately
every 10 ms, which enable SRT streams to be automatically restored after
a connection loss.

NOTE It is important to understand that with an SRT stream, the
**source** is the device that is *sending* the content (audio and/or
video data), while the **destination** is the device *receiving* the
content. Elsewhere, you may encounter references to an *SRT sender* and
an *SRT receiver*, but to avoid confusion in this document we will be
using the terms **source** and **destination**.

In some cases, a device can act as both the **source** and the
**destination**. For example, a Haivision Media Gateway may act as a
**destination** while receiving an SRT stream from a Makito X Encoder,
and then become a **source** device as it re-streams to a Makito X
Decoder.

#### SRT Call Modes

In order to establish a bidirectional stream, SRT employs a handshake
mechanism where each device identifies itself as a **Caller** or as a
**Listener**. In certain cases, two devices can simultaneously negotiate
an SRT session in what is referred to as **Rendezvous** mode. As you are
configuring SRT streams, you should understand these handshaking modes
and when to apply them:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| > SRT Call Mode       | > What it does        | > When to use it      |
+=======================+=======================+=======================+
| > Caller              | > Sets a **source**   | (1) To initiate       |
|                       | > or **destination**  |     point-to-point    |
|                       | > device as the       |     streaming (e.g.   |
|                       | > initiator of an SRT |     set a Makito X    |
|                       | > streaming session.  |     Encoder to Caller |
|                       | > The Caller device   |     mode to stream to |

|                       | > the Listener.       |     or vice versa).   |
|                       |                       |                       |
