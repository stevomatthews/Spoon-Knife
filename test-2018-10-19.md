### SRT Version History & Compatibility

SRT is designed to be backwards compatible, so that new or upgraded
Haivision products will be able to support SRT interactions with older
ones. Note, however, that newer versions of SRT may have features
unavailable on older   ones.

The table below shows the availability of SRT on various versions of
Haivision products:

### Basic SRT Concepts

#### Source & Destination

The SRT protocol relies on bi-directional UDP traffic to optimize video
streaming over public networks. In addition to the video data that is
sent in one direction --- from a content **source** device (such as a
Makito X Encoder) to a **destination** (such as a Makito X Decoder)

--- there is a constant exchange of control information between the two
endpoints, including "keep alive" packets (if needed) approximately
every 10 ms, which enable SRT streams to be automatically restored after
a connection loss.

NOTE It is important to understand that with an SRT stream, the
**source** is the device that is *sending* the content (audio and/or
video data), while the **destination** is the device *receiving* the
content. Elsewhere, you may encounter references to an *SRT sender* and
an *SRT receiver*, but to avoid confusion in this document we will be
using the terms **source** and **destination**.

In some cases, a device can act as both the **source** and the
**destination**. For example, a Haivision Media Gateway may act as a
**destination** while receiving an SRT stream from a Makito X Encoder,
and then become a **source** device as it re-streams to a Makito X
Decoder.

#### SRT Call Modes

In order to establish a bidirectional stream, SRT employs a handshake
mechanism where each device identifies itself as a **Caller** or as a
**Listener**. In certain cases, two devices can simultaneously negotiate
an SRT session in what is referred to as **Rendezvous** mode. As you are
configuring SRT streams, you should understand these handshaking modes
and when to apply them:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| > SRT Call Mode       | > What it does        | > When to use it      |
+=======================+=======================+=======================+
| > Caller              | > Sets a **source**   | (1) To initiate       |
|                       | > or **destination**  |     point-to-point    |
|                       | > device as the       |     streaming (e.g.   |
|                       | > initiator of an SRT |     set a Makito X    |
|                       | > streaming session.  |     Encoder to Caller |
|                       | > The Caller device   |     mode to stream to |

|                       | > and port number of  |     private network,  |
|                       | > the Listener.       |     or vice versa).   |
|                       |                       |                       |

SRT API Functions
=================



Library initialization
----------------------

```
int srt_startup(void);
```

This function shall be called at the start of an application that uses the SRT
library. It provides all necessary platform-specific initializations, sets up
global data, and starts the SRT GC thread. If this function isn't explicitly called,
it will be called automatically when creating the first socket. However, relying on
this behavior is strongly discouraged.

- Returns:
  *  0 = successfully run, or already started
  *  1 = this is the first startup, but the GC thread is already running
  * -1 = failed

- Errors:
  * `SRT_ECONNSETUP` (with error code set): Reported when required system
resource(s) failed to initialize. This is currently used only on Windows to report
a failure from `WSAStartup`.

```
int srt_cleanup(void);
```

This function cleans up all global SRT resources and shall be called just before exitting
the application that uses SRT library.

- Returns: 
  * 0 = for future use

**IMPORTANT**: Note that the startup/cleanup calls have an instance counter. This means
that if you call `srt_startup` multiple times, you need to call the `srt_cleanup` function exactly the same number of times.

Creating and configuring sockets
-------------------------------

```
SRTSOCKET srt_socket(int af, int type, int protocol);
```

Creates an SRT socket:

* `af`: family (either `AF_INET` or `AF_INET6`)
* `type`, `protocol`: ignored

**NOTE:** The UDT library uses the `type` parameter to specify file or message mode by
specifying that `SOCK_STREAM` corresponds to a TCP-like file transmission mode, and
`SOCK_DGRAM` corresponds to an SCTP-like message transmission mode. SRT still 
supports these modes. However, this is controlled by the `SRTO_MESSAGEAPI` socket
option when the transmission type is file (`SRTO_TRANSTYPE` set to `SRTT_FILE`)
and the only reasonable value for the `type` parameter here is `SOCK_DGRAM`.

- Returns:
  * a valid socket ID on success
  * `INVALID_SOCKET` (-1) on error

- Errors:
  * `SRT_ENOTBUF`: not enough memory to allocate required resources

**NOTE:** This is probably a design flaw (bug?). Usually underlying system errors are
reported by `SRT_ECONNSETUP`.<br><br>

```
int srt_bind(SRTSOCKET u, const struct sockaddr* name, int namelen);
```

Binds a socket to a local address and port. Binding specifies the local network
interface and the UDP port number to be used for the socket. When the local address
is a form of `INADDR_ANY`, then it's bound to all interfaces. When the port number
is 0, then the port number will be system-allocated if necessary.

For a listening socket this call is obligatory. It defines the network interface
and the port where the listener should expect a call request. For a connecting socket
this call can set up the outgoing port to be used in the communication. It is allowed
that multiple SRT sockets share one local outgoing port, as long as `SRTO_REUSEADDR`
is set to *true* (default).

*See **NOTE** below under* [`srt_create_socket`](#SRTSOCKET-srtcreatesocket).

- Returns:
  * `SRT_ERROR` (-1) on error, otherwise 0

- Errors:
  * `SRT_EINVSOCK`: Socket passed as `u` designates no valid socket
  * `SRT_EINVOP`: Socket already bound
  * `SRT_EINVPARAM`: Address family in `name` is not one set for `srt_socket`
  * `SRT_ECONNSETUP`: Internal creation of a UDP socket failed 
  * `SRT_ESOCKFAIL`: Internal configuring of a UDP socket (`bind`, `setsockopt`) failed<br><br>


```
SRTSOCKET srt_create_socket();
```

Creates a socket in `AF_INET` family only.

**NOTE:** In future the address family may be removed from initial socket configuration,
which will free the user from specifying it in `srt_socket`. The `srt_create_socket` function will be used for all families. The family will be specified only with the first
`srt_bind` or `srt_connect`, and in this case `SRT_EINVPARAM` will not be used (see [`srt_bind`](#int-srt_bind) above).<br><br>

```
int srt_bind_peerof(SRTSOCKET u, UDPSOCKET udpsock);
```

A version of `srt_bind` that acquires given UDP socket instead of creating one.

```
SRT_SOCKSTATUS srt_getsockstate(SRTSOCKET u);
```

Gets the current status of the socket. Possible states are:

* `SRTS_INIT`: Created, but not bound
* `SRTS_OPENED`: Created and bound, but not in use yet.
* `SRTS_LISTENING`: Socket is in listening state
* `SRTS_CONNECTING`: The connect operation was initiated, but not yet 
finished. This may also mean that it has timed out; you can only know
that after getting a socket error report from `srt_epoll_wait`. In blocking
mode it's not possible because `srt_connect` does not return until the
socket is connected or failed due to timeout or interrupted call.
* `SRTS_CONNECTED`: The socket is connected and ready for transmission.
* `SRTS_BROKEN`: The socket was connected, but the connection got broken
* `SRTS_CLOSING`: The socket may still be under some operation, but closing
is requested, so no further operation will be accepted, only finishing what
has been ordered so far
* `SRTS_CLOSED`: The socket has been closed, just not yet wiped out by GC
thread
* `SRTS_NONEXIST`: The given number designates no valid socket.

```
int srt_getsndbuffer(SRTSOCKET sock, size_t* blocks, size_t* bytes);
```

Retrieves information about the sender buffer.

* `sock`: Socket to test
* `blocks`: written information about buffer blocks in use
* `bytes`: written information about bytes in use

This function can be used for diagnostics, especially useful when the socket
needs to be closed asynchronously.


```
int srt_close(SRTSOCKET u);
```

Closes the socket and frees all used resources. Note that underlying UDP sockets
may be shared between sockets, so these are freed only with the last user closed.

Returns:
* `SRT_ERROR` (-1) in case of error, otherwise 0

Errors:
* `SRT_EINVSOCK`: Socket `u` designates no valid socket ID
